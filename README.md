## Dataset Description
From March 2012 to December 2023, this dataset collects monthly housing price data for about 6,000 ZIP codes spread across 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. With the addition of socioeconomic indicators, points of interest (POI) in each area, and other real estate metrics like sales volumes and indexes, it includes more than 890,000 records. We will use this dataset to explore trends, regional differences, and develop a model that predicts housing markets in the United States.
